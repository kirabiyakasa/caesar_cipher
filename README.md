Ceasar Cipher for The Odin Project.

My first Ruby project. Initially there were 2 additonal methods; one for
shifting left(negative numbers) and one for shifting right(positive numbers).
I reworked the code, using absolute value and reversing the alphabet instead of 
using negative numbers for shifting left.
